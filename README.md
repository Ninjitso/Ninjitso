- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ninjitso, greetings to all my fellow coder gals and dudes
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, eventhough I haven't coded in a very long time. Music, running, general sports and fitness, food and family
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about blockchains via YouTube thanks to FreeCodeCamp.org and about to start on Solidity
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on blockchain related projects once I have a handle of it
- 📫 How to reach me is here. I will make sure I logon to GitHub as often as possible.
